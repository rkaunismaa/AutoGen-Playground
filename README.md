# AutoGen-Playground 

This will be my playground for all things using AutoGen.

One of my primary source of code samples will be the [Microsoft AutoGen Examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples/)

One of the principle goals of this playground is to always use a local Large Language Model, and stay away from OpenAI.

conda activate autogen
